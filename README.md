# About this folder 
To demonstrate some technical knowledge, I have selected a few projects from school
which are both readable and demonstrates some technical skills. 

Please note that "Java" and "React Native" were group-projects. Therefore, their respective 
READMEs detail my contributions. This way I do not take credit for someone else's work. 

The folder demonstrates some of the following skills: 
 - Java: 
	 - Object-oriented programming with abstract classes, interfaces and such. 
	 - Some more knowledge of Java 
	 - While an Android-project, it was made using a game-engine which hides some skills of using pure Android. 
 - React Native: 
	 - Pure JS programming and functional programming 
	 - Use of React Native 
 - REST Get sample (not a group project) 
	 - Knowledge of REST 
	 - Thorough documentation in the README 

If there's any questions, or if anything should be expanded upon, please ask me at 
[jonasbgi@stud.ntnu.no](mailto:jonasbgi@stud.ntnu.no). 

What's not demontrated here is documentation beyond README, such as various views and diagrams, as well as debugging skills. 
The views and diagrams were all made in groups, which meant I could not take the full credit for them, and therefore was not comfortable including them here. 

Lastly, there may be minor flaws here and there in project. Sadly I have not had the time to go over these files with a fine-toothed comb. I still hope they can serve their purpose of demontrating some skills and good practises.
